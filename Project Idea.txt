so like you know how the people in india get SMS from banks and all sorts of things? i want to mask them all

for example: 
SMS
you have paid rs 100 to abc and your balance is rs 1000

templete
you have paid rs <AMOUNT> to <RECEIVER> and your balance is rs <BALANCE>

i have to mask all of them this way for every sort of message

casa, cc, wallet, utility, insurance, loan, and investment messages

i previously used regex to make these templates but it very unreliable and not accurate as banks can chnage their message templates whenever they want.

therefore i want to make a system which can automaically make templates from the SMS messages.
